          Many of your lives have been upended as your employers have been forced to cut hours,
          suspend their business, permanently close and lay off employees.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have urgent, necessary expenses like groceries, utilities, rent, medicine or baby food that
          you are unable to pay for until you receive federal assistance or unemployment insurance, or if
          you do not qualify for those benefits, The Plate Fund may be able to assist during this difficult
          time.
