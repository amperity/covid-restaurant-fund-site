        <h5>The Need is Urgent</h5>
        <p>
          When the COVID-19 crisis hit the Seattle area, more than
          100,000 people were employed at some 5,000 food
          establishments in King County. Thousands of restaurants have
          suspended operations, closed and let go a majority or their
          staffs. A vast majority of line cooks, wait staff,
          dishwashers and other employees rely on every paycheck, as
          well as tips, to support themselves and their families. They
          need to pay for necessities like food, housing, baby
          products and medicine now.
        </p>

        <h5>How to Help Now</h5>
        <p>
          The Plate Fund provides immediate, one-time payments of $500
          to the most impacted workers. For many, these payments can
          help “bridge the gap” between the time they received their
          last paychecks and when they can access federal stimulus
          payments and/or unemployment insurance benefits, which can
          take weeks of months. For others, this may be the only money
          they receive.

          Restaurants, bars and cafes are the connective tissue in our
          communities, nourishing all of us and helping to keep our
          neighborhoods vibrant. Now they need us. Please, donate what
          you can—the cost of a cup of coffee, a dinner out, a month
          of meals—to help us reach more workers. It’s our time to
          serve.
