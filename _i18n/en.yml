  overview_title: What is The Plate Fund?
  overview_content:
    - |
      The COVID-19 crisis is devastating for thousands of
      restaurant-industry workers who have lost their jobs and rely on
      every paycheck to afford necessities like food, transportation,
      baby products and medicine.
    - |
      To help, The Plate Fund is providing immediate financial
      assistance to those who have been hardest-hit in King County.
    - |
      The need is enormous, and the money the fund distributes is
      limited to what we raise in the days and weeks ahead. While our
      goal is to help as many people as possible, priority is given to
      applicants most in need, and the order applications are
      received.
    - Please donate and apply today!

  donate_overview: |
    When the COVID-19 crisis hit the Seattle area, more than 100,000
    people were employed at some 5,000 food establishments in King
    County. Thousands of restaurants have suspended operations, closed
    and let go a majority of their staff. A vast majority of line
    cooks, wait staff, dishwashers and other employees rely on every
    paycheck, as well as tips, to support themselves and their
    families. They need to pay for necessities like food,
    transportation, baby products and medicine now.

      The Plate Fund provides immediate, one-time payments of $500
      to the most impacted workers. For many, these payments can
      help “bridge the gap” between the time they received their
      last paychecks and when they can access federal stimulus
      payments and/or unemployment insurance benefits, which can
      take weeks or months. For others, this may be the only money
      they receive.
    - |
      Restaurants, bars and cafes are the connective tissue in our
      communities, nourishing all of us and helping to keep our
      neighborhoods vibrant. Now they need us. Please, donate what
      you can—the cost of a cup of coffee, a dinner out, a month
      of meals—to help us reach more workers. It’s our time to
      serve.

    'Why focus on workers in the restaurant industry?':
      - |
        The restaurant industry is being hard hit by the COVID-19
        crisis. The National Restaurant Association recently predicted
        that restaurants across the country will lose $225 billion in
        business, and that 5 to 7 million service and kitchen jobs
        could be lost over the next three months. And the effects are
        certainly being felt right here in King County. When the
        COVID-19 crisis hit the Seattle area, more than 100,000 people
        were employed at some 5,000 food establishments in King
        County. Thousands of restaurants have closed, suspended
        operations and let go all or some of their staff.
      - |
        The Washington State Employment Security Department reported
        that accommodation and food service unemployment claims rose
        ten-fold in a single week during the third week of March and
        reached over 68,000 total new claims for the month. Every
        single one of King County’s more than 5,000 restaurants are
        being impacted, especially single-establishment and smaller
        restaurants that may not have the resources to support their
        staffs through the crisis. A vast majority of these workers
        rely on every paycheck, as well as tips, to support themselves
        and their families. They need to pay for necessities like
        food, transportation, baby products and medicine now.
    'Why can’t workers rely on government support via stimulus payments and unemployment benefits?':
      - |
        Government support is on the way for many, but for a lot
        of workers it is not arriving quickly enough. King
        County’s unemployment system has seen a more than 2,000%
        rise in claims in just three short weeks and is working
        through a backlog of these claims, delaying payments to
        many of those in need. Similarly, the individual
        Economic Impact Payments offered as part of the Federal
        Government’s CARES Act might take between three and four
        months to reach some recipients. This means many of our
        local restaurant workers currently have reduced or no
        income to cover rent, food, utilities, healthcare and
        other basic needs. The Plate Fund hopes to help fill
        this gap with an immediate cash infusion of $500.
    'Why provide cash?':
      - |
        Timing matters most. While there is no direct
        comparison, we can take lessons from other
        initiatives. Quick cash transfers at moments of need
        have proven effective as a disaster response and in
        helping people avoid housing instability and food
        insecurity. Cash is the best tool as it provides
        individuals with the flexibility to meet their most
        urgent needs. There is a strong global evidence base
        that cash transfers are efficient and effective,
        particularly when delivered intentionally and at the
        right moment. It also reduces administrative costs,
        freeing up resources to reach more people.
    'How does it work?':
      - |
        The Plate Fund provides $500 emergency relief grants to
        individuals in King County who have lost their jobs in
        the restaurant industry or are experiencing
        significantly reduced hours of work due to the COVID-19
        crisis. The application is a simple process. To apply,
        applicants must:
      - |
        <ul class="font-weight-light">
          <li>Upload a pay stub dated on or after March 1, 2020;</li>
          <li>Upload one form of government issued identification or two forms of alternate identification that includes an applicant’s residential address;</li>
          <li>Demonstrate that their gross income is no more than $62,000 per year, inclusive of tips;</li>
          <li>Provide bank account information;</li>
          <li>Verify that they have experienced a decrease in work hours or loss of their job.</li>
        </ul>
      - |
        Payments are made electronically. Applicants may receive
        funding as soon as 48 hours after their application is
        approved. Applications will be processed as fast as
        possible, however processing times may vary based on the
        volume of applications received.
      - |
        Applications are reviewed and processed by UpTogether, a
        digital capital exchange platform that helps low-income
        people accelerate their economic mobility.
      - |
        We recognize a small percentage of restaurant workers do not
        have bank accounts. We are working to add functionality to
        provide payments via debit or gift cards in the coming
        weeks. We will also provide applicants with information about
        where they may open no-cost bank accounts. In addition, we
        have created a way for restaurant owners and managers to
        target these relief payments to their most needy former
        employees. In some cases, The Plate Fund will provide unique
        codes to restaurant owners to distribute directly to affected
        workers. Individuals who receive a code will have to complete
        the online application, but their applications will receive
        expedited processing.
    'How is The Plate Fund different from other efforts helping people financially impacted by the pandemic?':
      - |
        This fund is the only one of its kind that enables emergency
        cash to go directly to individuals who worked in one of the
        hardest hit sectors of our local economy. It is one part of a
        set of complementary efforts all designed to direct support to
        those most impacted by the current crisis. We are working
        collaboratively with the United Way of King County, local
        philanthropies as well as our city, county and state leaders
        to help as many of our neighbors as possible.
